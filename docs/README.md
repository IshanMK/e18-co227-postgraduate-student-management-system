## Problem

* Currently the system we use for managing the postgraduate students is not suitable , because the system is not user friendly.

   ![Screenshot_2022-06-29_151736-removebg-preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73387606/176407296-fbc7a165-0cdf-4a07-961f-e01787952b34.png)
   
* Submission and processing delays (Synchronization effects with submissions)
* Difficulties in managing multiple platforms
* Delaying graduation and program completion.
* There should be a place to publish the students' reports and thesis.   

## Solution

* So we decided to implement interactive <code><i>Web Application</i></code>. This system consists of ,
    * Student Registration System
         * The main role is to register users on the system and store their sensitive information in the database 
         * Secure than G-sheets
         * Easy to manage user data (G-sheets, G-forms replaced)
    * User Management Facility System
         * Different user roles, only the admin can  Insert, delete and update data
    * Progress and Performance Monitorin System
         * Allows supervisors, and examiners to monitor the progress of the students
         * Coordinators can get a better idea about students' performance
         * Also students can get an idea about their progress in postgraduate program
    * Automated Event Management System
         * A most important part G-Sheets and G-forms can't do automated events
         * It- Easier for coordinators to get a reminder as well as students
         * Automated Email and Notification System is developed in this part
         * This prevents submission and processing delays
         
## Technology Stack

* ReactJS
   * Improves the quality of user interface
   * Open source and easy to use
   * Less coding and gives more functionality
   * Performance Enhancement by using virtual DOM

* Express JS
   * Can handle a higher level of requests efficiently
   * Can integrate several third-party applications and services with ExpressJS.
   * fast application development in a limited time
 
* MongoDB
   * Mongo DB is one of the most useful database layers
   * The database allows modern apps to be easily developed, tested, and hosted on the cloud
